    # Put in readCardInfo after defining a dictionary

    #database = openpyxl.load_workbook("cfvdatabase.xlsx")
    #currentPage = database.active

    #headers = [currentPage.cell(row = 1, column = i).value for i in range(1, currentPage.max_column + 1)]
    
    #dataArray = []
    #for keyword in headers:
        #dataArray.append(str(dictionary.get(keyword)))
    
    #cardTuple = tuple(dataArray)
    #print(headers)
    #print(cardTuple)
    #currentPage.append(cardTuple)

    #database.save("cfvdatabase.xlsx")
